Here are some things that I would like to use GitHub Actions to prevent me from committing to the repo:

- Deleting or modifying files: I would not want to accidentally delete or modify files in your repository. I would like to be able to make changes to files, but I would want to be sure that I am not deleting or modifying anything important.
- Adding sensitive information: I would not want to accidentally add sensitive information to your repository. This could include things like your personal information, your financial information, or your company's secrets.
- Making changes that I am not authorized to make: I would not want to make changes to files that I am not authorized to make. This could include files that are owned by other people, or files that are in a restricted directory.
